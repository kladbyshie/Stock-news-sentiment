# Stock-news-sentiment

Utility to analyze sentiment of articles about a particular stock, sourced from Yahoo Finance. 
Uses Selenium + Newspaper to source and parse the articles and text, NLTK Vader to analyze the sentiment, Plotly to visualize the results as a bar chart, and Flask/Waitress to provide a rudimentary GUI for it. This was more of an introductory NLP project for me, so it's more of a proof-of-concept.

Room to grow:
* Selenium is only used because Yahoo Finance has infinite scroll; using a different source of info would cut down the time it takes to generate the end result quite a bit. 
* Newspaper is a bit slow; figuring out if alternatives are faster are a potential solution.
* The plot generated by Plotly is kind of janky; Ideally, it would group up the sentiments by date, and not show any other data on the X axis except for the date. Haven't figured out how to show just that yet. Currently, however, it's perfectly usable.
* The Flask GUI is kind of ugly; ideally, having the option to export the dataset would be nice, and having a progress bar (ie. "data downloaded! beginning parsing") would be optimal, especially with how slow the entire program currently is. It's usable now, but not ideal.
